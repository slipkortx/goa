<!--A server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user,
 also known as the client. In a data center,
 the physical computer that a server program runs on is also frequently referred to as a server.
 That machine might be a dedicated server or it might be used for other purposes.-->


 <!--The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server,
  asking it to send a copy of the website to the client (you go to the shop and order your goods).
   This message, and all other data sent between the client and the server.
  is sent across your internet connection using TCP/IP.-->
